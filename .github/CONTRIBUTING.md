# Contributing
**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have questions, please ask it in [The Official Discord](https://discord.gg/eMz8HhA) instead of opening an issue -- you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to language files, please switch to the "lang" branch there. If you want to contribute to the codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request (you'll be mostly asked to do that if you submit an issue).

## Setup
Setting up this mod is like setting up any other Minecraft mod, and is originally built for Eclipse. If this is your first time setting up a mod or modding, please refrain from submitting pull requests until you've had more experience.
